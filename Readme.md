My 100 Days of Machine Learning Journey with CampusX
🚀 Welcome to My Repository!
This repository is my personal journal and code sanctuary for the 100 Days of Machine Learning course by CampusX. I've embarked on this journey to build a strong foundation in Machine Learning and Data Science, from the ground up. Here, I'll be documenting my daily progress, sharing all the code I write, and summarizing my key learnings.

Follow along with my journey!

👨‍🏫 About the Course
This incredible course is curated by Gaurav Sir (CampusX). The curriculum is designed to cover everything from Python basics for ML to advanced topics like Deep Learning, with a strong focus on practical implementation and intuition behind the algorithms. My goal is to diligently follow the lectures, complete the assignments, and build a portfolio of projects.

Web Scraping for DataFrames

Day 18 Notebook

- Mastered the basics of web scraping using requests and BeautifulSoup.<br>- Learned to parse HTML and find specific elements by their tags.<br>- Successfully extracted data from a website and structured it into a DataFrame.


🛠️ Projects
This section showcases the major projects I've built during this 100-day journey.

Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
Description: A classic classification problem to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, class, and sex.
